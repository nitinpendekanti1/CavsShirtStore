The full website is in the website-with-cnn branch. It can be run with the python script "app.py", a python
flask app that renders the htmls and creates the CNN. There are a few bugs with the images in this branch.

The master branch has no image bugs and can be viewed by opening the index.HTML file in your preferred web
browser. It can also be viewed using Live Server in VS Code.
