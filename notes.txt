end goal: recommender
My idea is to prompt the user to select some shirts they like, then
recommend similar shirts based off of embeddings created by a CNN.



1. Read in shirt data
"resize_rename_images" reads the 23 shirt images under /static/raw_shirts
it resizes them all to 244x244 and renames them

2. Get the embeddings
I made a tensorflow CNN. In the "predict_embeddings"
function, I create each embedding using the models
predict function (model.predict)

1. fix shirt images to work with CNN
2. Add a recommendations page (recommend.html):
- allow the user to choose 3 of 10 randomly chosen shirts that are displayed to the screen
- when 3 are chosen, a continue button appears at the top
- find the centroid of the embeddings for the 3 shirts
- find the top 5 most similar shirts to the centroid with cosine scoring
- when continue is clicked, redirect to centroid.html
- on centroid.html, output centroid embedding


The flow of the program is like this: the user starts on index, they click 
on go to cnn button to redirect to the cnn.html, then they click on start
shopping, and get to choose 3 out of 10 items, once 3 items are chosen, they
can click a continue button to redirect to index.html. The centroid of the
embeddings of the 3 items they chose needs to be calculated, and the top 3
most similar items to the centroid need to be found. Index.html should 
appear similar, but now filters out any items not in the top 3 items after
the redirect.
